# Problems I had to solve 

## What is an API?

Since this was my first time communicating with a third-party API, I had to learn that quickly as well.

## What method should I use to retrieve data using JavaScript

For JavaScript I had two options, Fetch API and XHR. For educational purposes I used both.

## I wanted to do lazy loading, How do I do that?

I learned about how to use the Intersection Observer API from javascript. Basically I made the pictures only load when they are on screen.

## How do I load more GIFS infinitely?

The GIPHY API has a built-in offset parameter in the request. So I used that everytime a user would need to load more.


# Things I learned along the way

* Asynchronous requests
* AJAX
* XHR and FETCH
* Intersection Observer
* Lazy Loading
